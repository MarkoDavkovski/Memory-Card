Welcome to the Memory Card Game project! This interactive game, built using Vite and React, is designed to enhance your memory and concentration skills while exploring the world of modern web development. Throughout this project, I've gained insights into React components, state management, hooks, and using Vite as a fast build tool. Test your memory prowess by revealing cards and making matches, all while striving to achieve your highest score!
